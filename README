== installation ==
gem install ups_time_in_transit

== usage ==

# define your access options.  These are options that won't change 
# between requests.  Take care to specify the proper UPS url:
# 'https://wwwcie.ups.com/ups.app/xml/TimeInTransit' for testing and
# development, and 'https://onlinetools.ups.com/ups.app/xml/TimeInTransit'
# for production.
access_options = {
  :url => 'https://wwwcie.ups.com/ups.app/xml/TimeInTransit',
  :access_license_number => 'foo',
  :user_id => 'bar',
  :password => 'baz',
  :order_cutoff_time => 17 ,
  :sender_city => 'Hoboken',
  :sender_state => 'NJ',
  :sender_country_code => 'US',
  :sender_zip => '07030'}

# It's best to store these these options in a yaml file and load them
# into a map when you need them:
yaml = YAML.load_file("#{RAILS_ROOT}/config/ups_time_in_transit.yml")
access_options = yaml[RAILS_ENV].inject({}){|h,(k, v)| h[k.to_sym] = v; h}

# create an api instance with your access options
time_in_transit_api = UPS::TimeInTransit.new(access_options)

# for each request, generate a map of request options describing
# the shipment and where it's going
request_options = {
  :total_packages => 1,
  :unit_of_measurement => 'LBS',
  :weight => 10,
  :city => 'Newark',
  :state => 'DE',
  :zip => '19711',
  :country_code => 'US'}

# request the map of delivery types (overnight, ground, etc.) to the expected 
# delivery date for that type.  Be sure to rescue any errors.
begin
  delivery_dates = time_in_transit_api.request(request_options)
rescue => error
  puts error.inspect
end

== changelog ==
v.0.1.5
  Added the ability to optionally specify the date you are shipping the package on, instead of assuming it's today. If you specify a shipping date that is ivalid, the first available pick-up time will be used (calculated in a function based on the last daily pick-up time and day of the week).
  When adding the pick-up date you must specify it in the following string format --> YYYYMMDD, i.e. 20151225 --> Christmas day 2015.

  Example of usage:
    request_options = {
	  :pickup_date => "20151225",
	  ...
    }

  Minor bug fix to project files.
